On this site I'm documenting my experience making games.

I've developed a programming language for video games called
<a class="button" href="https://github.com/tomtsagk/avdl.git">avdl</a>
, and I've
made a few games with it already.

Check out games I've made on the
<a class="menu" href="/games">Games</a>
tab.
