Handmade infinity snood in multiple colours, for handling the cold and looking your best.

They are double layered, and very stretchy. They are made with aran thick yarn with colourful wool flecks. The neck warmer can be worn as-is to cover your neck and part of your face, or fold it in half when it's a bit warmer.
