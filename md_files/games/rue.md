## Description

Players are in love with The Rose. Make the right decisions, to beat the competition!

In Rue, one player has The Rose in front of them, while the other players are trying to take it back.

Cards can be used to move The Rose around, allow you to grab it, or plainly steal it from others. All players play their card at the same time,making the right decisions is the key to victory.

The game is played in rounds that last a couple of minutes each. Once a player has won ~3 rounds, they are the winner.
